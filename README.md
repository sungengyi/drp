# Friendly Notice: Crawling GitHub HTML for Academic Research

Hi GitHub Team,

I'm a graduate student conducting software engineering research involving GitHub repositories. As part of this work, I am crawling a limited set of GitHub Pull Request HTML pagesto collect publicly available data. I am doing so because the GitHub REST API does not include an endpoint for the "force-push" events. **I am doing this solely for research purposes, not for commercial use.**

I’m doing my best to ensure that the crawling is respectful by limiting request frequency, identifying my scraper with a custom User-Agent, and backing off if any rate limits or blocks are encountered.

If my traffic is unintentionally too frequent, please do not hesitate to reach out. I’m more than happy to adjust my crawler’s behavior immediately. 

You can contact me at:

**gengyi.sun@uwaterloo.ca**

Please do not block my IP or the University of Waterloo’s network. I’m committed to collaborating respectfully with GitHub’s infrastructure and policies.

Thank you for your incredible platform and for supporting research through access to open-source activity.

Best regards,

Gengyi Sun
PhD Student, University of Waterloo
